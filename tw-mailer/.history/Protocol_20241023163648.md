### Client and Server Architecture

The project follows a client-server architecture where the server handles email storage and retrieval, and the client interacts with the server to perform these operations. The server is responsible for managing user directories, storing emails in JSON format, and providing functionalities to list, retrieve, and delete emails. The client sends requests to the server to perform these actions.

### Used Technologies

- **Programming Languages**: C++ and C using the UNIX Sockets
- **Libraries**:
    - `nlohmann/json` for JSON parsing and serialization
    - `std::filesystem` for file and directory operations
    - `UUIDv4` for generating unique identifiers for emails

### Development Strategy and Needed Adaptations

#### Development Strategy

1. **Modular Design**: The project is divided into multiple classes and files to ensure modularity and separation of concerns. For example, `mailHandler` is responsible for handling email-related operations.
2. **UUID Generation**: Unique identifiers for emails are generated using the `UUIDv4` library to ensure each email has a unique filename.
3. **JSON Serialization**: Emails are stored in JSON format to facilitate easy serialization and deserialization.
4. **Filesystem Operations**: The project uses `std::filesystem` to manage directories and files, ensuring compatibility with modern C++ standards.

#### Needed Adaptations

1. Add the required commands for the Protocol to the client and sender
2. Implement the email storage as json
3. Add functions to receive and display the mails on the client side
4. Sending mail from one user to another
5. Restructured the Server into multiple classes
6. **Not yet implemented**: Authentication using LDAP
7. **Not yet implemented**: Login and session management
